## Why Use Bootstrap in an LMS?
Many LMS platforms—like Canvas, Blackboard, and Moodle—utilize HTML design principles from the Bootstrap framework. By integrating Bootstrap’s responsive, ready-to-use components, educators can create engaging, accessible content without advanced coding skills. This resource is designed to expose Bootstrap's built-in design capabilities within the LMS, making them available for you to enhance your own eLearning courses.

## How to Use Bootstrap in an LMS
Using Bootstrap components in your LMS course is as easy as copying and pasting the HTML code into the LMS’s content editor. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

 1. Access the HTML Editor in Your LMS: Most LMS platforms allow you to switch between a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor and an HTML editor. To insert Bootstrap code, you need to access the HTML editor.
    * Canvas: Open any page or assignment, click the "Edit" button, and switch to the HTML Editor using the icon that looks like </>.
    * Blackboard: Navigate to a content area, open the HTML editor, and paste the Bootstrap code.
    * Moodle: In the course section, open the HTML editor from the text editor toolbar.

2. Copy & Paste Bootstrap Code: Simply copy the HTML code provided in this resource and paste it directly into the LMS's HTML editor. The framework's pre-built components (such as grids, buttons, forms, or tables) will be displayed in your LMS page.

3. Preview & Customize: Once you paste the code, preview the content to ensure it looks correct. You can customize the content as needed—changing text, colors, or button styles to fit your course theme or institution’s brand.

4. Save and Test Responsiveness: After making changes, save the page and view it on different devices (desktop, tablet, phone) to ensure that the content is responsive and accessible to all learners.
